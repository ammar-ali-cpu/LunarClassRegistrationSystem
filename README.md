# Lunar Class Regsistration System -  Ammar Ali

## Description
Students at Stony Brook University commonly use a system called "Solar" to register for classes every semester. There has been 
a lot of criticism surrounding this system due to its user-unfriendliness and complex appearance. Discussions amongst students 
have led to the conclusion that a better system can be created by some of the unviersity's Computer Science majors. This inspired 
me to create my own registration system called "Lunar" in which I emphasize ease-of-use.

This is a full-stack project, created using Java and Swing, implementing all the basic functions of a registration system.
When you run the GUIMain.java file, a graphical user interface prompting the user to log in should pop up.


## Usage
The system comes with a login predefined for the Registrar. Functions reserved for the registrar include:
- registering students
- de-registering students
- creating courses
- removing courses
- viewing course enrollment

For students, the following functions are available:
- adding a class to schedule
- dropping a class
- viewing classes sourted by course name
- viewing classes sorted by semester

All data is locally automatically locally saved and loaded upon run.

## Features coming soon
Saving data to databases instead of locally
